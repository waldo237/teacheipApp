What do they need to get\r\n          there?\"\r\n        </i>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <v-layout\r\n          row\r\n          wrap\r\n          justify-end\r\n        >\r\n          <q\r\n            class=\"my-1 white--text\"\r\n          ><small>(Janine Sepulveda, 2019)</small></q>\r\n        </v-layout>\r\n      </blockquote>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <!-- these are the flex boxes for the content -->\r\n    <v-layout\r\n      row\r\n      wrap\r\n      justify-center\r\n      class=\"mb-5 pb-5\"\r\n    >\r\n      <a \r\n        class=\"move\"\r\n        style=\"text-decoration:none;\"\r\n        href=\"https://www.wabisabilearning.com/blog/15-assessment-activities-fast-formative\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\"\r\n      >\r\n        <div\r\n          class=\"column\"\r\n          style=\"flex-grow:1;flex-shrink:1;flex-basis:0;text-align:center;background-color:rgb(19,83,147);box-shadow:0 10px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.425), 0 14px 30px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.356);margin:10px;padding:10px;border-radius:15%;\"\r\n        >\r\n          <small style=\"color:white;\"> Collection 1</small><br>\r\n          <img\r\n            src=\"https://png.pngtree.com/svg/20170620/d1dbd7379c.png\"\r\n            alt=\"Formative assessment repository\"\r\n            style=\"width:100px;height:100px;\"\r\n          >\r\n        </div>\r\n      </a>\r\n      <!-- second item -->\r\n      <a\r\n        class=\"move\"\r\n        style=\"text-decoration:none;\"\r\n        href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Zl4c43xZjTSXZKdGhnSUFtUEFQR0RJTWNnWFR6RzhpTE9r/view?usp=sharing\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\"\r\n      >\r\n        <div\r\n          class=\"column\"\r\n          style=\"flex-grow:1;flex-shrink:1;flex-basis:0;text-align:center;background-color:rgb(19,83,147);box-shadow:0 10px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.425), 0 14px 30px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.356);margin:10px;padding:10px;border-radius:15%;\"\r\n        >\r\n          <small style=\"color:white;\"> Collection 2</small><br>\r\n          <img\r\n            src=\"https://png.pngtree.com/svg/20170620/d1dbd7379c.png\"\r\n            alt=\"Formative assessment repository\"\r\n            style=\"width:100px;height:100px;\"\r\n          >\r\n        </div>\r\n      </a>\r\n      <!-- third item -->\r\n      <a\r\n        class=\"move\"\r\n        style=\"text-decoration:none;\"\r\n        href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Zl4c43xZjTYVkwcXVmMnJsQnVIcDNyT1J4SGEtb2E2czBJ/view?usp=sharing\"\r\n        target=\"_blank\"\r\n      >\r\n        <div\r\n          class=\"column\"\r\n          style=\"flex-grow:1;flex-shrink:1;flex-basis:0;text-align:center;background-color:rgb(19,83,147);box-shadow:0 10px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.425), 0 14px 30px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.356);margin:10px;padding:10px;border-radius:15%;\"\r\n        >\r\n          <small style=\"color:white;\"> Collection 3</small><br>\r\n          <img\r\n            src=\"https://png.pngtree.com/svg/20170620/d1dbd7379c.png\"\r\n            alt=\"Formative assessment repository\"\r\n            style=\"width:100px;height:100px;\"\r\n          >\r\n        </div>\r\n      </a>\r\n    </v-layout>\r\n  </v-layout>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<style  scoped>\r\n.move:hover{\r\n   animation-duration: 0.5s;\r\n  animation-name: pulse;\r\n  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;\r\n}\r\n.bigger{\r\n  font-size: 120% !important;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./formative.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
